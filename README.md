# Information Retrieval Mini Project - Query System

This project implements a simple **Information Retrieval (IR) system** with a **GUI interface** using Tkinter.  
The system builds an **inverted index** from a set of document abstracts, computes **TF-IDF vectors**, and allows the user to perform **query-based retrieval** with ranked results.
